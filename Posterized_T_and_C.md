- Your subscription **renews automatically** at the end of each billing period unless canceled.
- By subscribing, you authorize Apple to charge your payment method in accordance with the terms displayed in the App Store.
- Apple may charge you up to 24 hours before the current period ends.

You can manage or cancel your subscription at any time via **iOS Settings > [Your Name] > Subscriptions**.

If we change subscription prices, Apple will notify you where required, and price changes will apply starting from your next billing period. If you do not agree, you should cancel before the renewal.

### Cancellation

You may cancel your subscription at any time through iOS Settings. When you cancel:

- Your subscription remains active until the end of the current billing period.
- You will not be charged for any further periods after cancellation.
